Brackets-Themes
===============

Easy and accessible way of loading code mirror themes into brackets.


To do
===============

Currently I save the current theme in the preferences via the PreferencesManager, which unfortunately seem to get lost when reloading brackets.  I would like to make the current theme a bit more permanent so that users don't have to set it every time brackets is started.
